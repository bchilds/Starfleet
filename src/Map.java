    This class:
    - generates a map to output
    - Processes moves and actions
    - checks Mine states and ship position
    - generates new map to output
    - iterates to next move/action

    Takes in a list of commands and a list of Mines, uses this to generate map size and ship coordinates
        A movement is actually a change in map size, as ship is always center of the map
