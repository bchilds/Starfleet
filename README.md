# Starfleet
Starfleet project

5-3-17

This project is an exercise a friend had as an interview problem. I chose to implement this in Java as a learning exercise. 
The purpose of the starfleet project is to input a text file with a field of "mines" represented by letters. 
Each iteration, the starship (at the center of the visible field) can move or shoot missiles or both.
Commands are input in a pre-made sequence using another text file.
Runs are scored based on pass/fail (all mines destroyed, mines passed, mines remaining, etc)
The visible field is determined each iteration by the dimensions necessary to display the outermost mines, with the ship always kept in the center of the field.
